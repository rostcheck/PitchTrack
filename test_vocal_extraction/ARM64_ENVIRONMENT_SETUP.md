# Setting Up Python 3.11 with arm64 Architecture for Vocal Extraction

## What We Accomplished

1. **Installed arm64 Homebrew**:
   - Successfully installed Homebrew in `/opt/homebrew` which is the standard location for arm64 architecture on Apple Silicon Macs
   - This is separate from the x86_64 Homebrew installation in `/usr/local`

2. **Installed Python 3.11 with arm64 architecture**:
   - Used arm64 Homebrew to install Python 3.11.13 with native arm64 support
   - Verified the installation with `python -c "import platform; print(platform.machine())"`

3. **Created a new virtual environment**:
   - Set up `venv_py311_arm64` using the arm64 Python 3.11 installation
   - Confirmed the virtual environment is using Python 3.11.13 on arm64 architecture

4. **Installed Demucs and dependencies**:
   - Successfully installed Demucs and all its dependencies in the arm64 environment
   - Verified Demucs functionality with a test script
   - Confirmed that PyTorch is using MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) for hardware acceleration

5. **Created test scripts**:
   - `test_arm64_env.py`: To verify the environment setup
   - `test_spleeter.py`: Ready for when Spleeter becomes compatible

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Spleeter Compatibility Issues**:
   - Spleeter requires specific versions of dependencies that are not compatible with Python 3.11 on arm64:
     - Requires TensorFlow 2.12.1, which is not available for Python 3.11 on arm64
     - Requires NumPy 1.18.5, which has build issues on Python 3.11
   - Attempted multiple versions of Spleeter (2.1.0, 2.4.0, 2.4.2) without success

2. **Architecture Mismatch**:
   - The original virtual environment was using x86_64 architecture on an arm64 machine
   - This caused compatibility issues and performance penalties due to Rosetta 2 translation

## Lessons Learned

1. **Architecture Matters**:
   - Using native arm64 Python on Apple Silicon provides better performance and compatibility
   - Mixing architectures (x86_64 Python on arm64 Mac) can lead to dependency conflicts

2. **Homebrew Installation Location**:
   - On Apple Silicon Macs, arm64 Homebrew should be installed in `/opt/homebrew`
   - x86_64 Homebrew is installed in `/usr/local`
   - Both can coexist, but packages are installed in different locations

3. **Python Package Compatibility**:
   - Not all Python packages are available or compatible with arm64 architecture
   - Older packages like Spleeter may have dependencies that don't support newer Python versions on arm64
   - TensorFlow has specific version requirements for different Python versions and architectures

## Next Steps

1. **For Spleeter**:
   - Consider using a Docker container with compatible versions
   - Research if newer versions of Spleeter might work with newer TensorFlow versions
   - Explore alternative vocal separation libraries if Spleeter remains incompatible

2. **For Demucs**:
   - Continue using the arm64 environment for Demucs
   - Optimize performance by leveraging MPS acceleration

3. **General**:
   - Use the arm64 Python 3.11 environment for future development
   - Keep the environment updated with compatible packages
   - Document any workarounds for specific packages
