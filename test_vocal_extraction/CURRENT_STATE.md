# Current State of Vocal Extraction Testing

## Overview
We've completed our comparison of Spleeter and Demucs for vocal extraction to determine which method works better for the PitchTrack application.

## Research Findings
1. **Demucs**:
   - Provides superior vocal isolation quality with minimal bleed-through
   - Processing time: ~56.7 seconds
   - Best option for high-quality vocal extraction where accuracy is critical

2. **Spleeter**:
   - Multiple models tested (2-stem, 4-stem, 5-stem)
   - Processing times: 8.9-13.0 seconds (4-5x faster than Demucs)
   - Quality comparison:
     - 5-stem model provides the best quality among Spleeter models
     - 4-stem model is better than 2-stem model
     - All Spleeter models show more instrumental bleed-through than Demucs

3. **Best Practices Implemented**:
   - High-pass filtering (150 Hz) improved vocal clarity
   - Proper audio format handling (samples, channels)
   - Multi-stem models for better separation

## Conclusion
**Demucs is the recommended solution for PitchTrack application** due to its superior vocal isolation quality, despite being slower than Spleeter. The quality of vocal isolation is critical for accurate pitch tracking, making Demucs the better choice.

## Environment Setup
- Working Python 3.11 virtual environment in `venv_py311_arm64/` with arm64 architecture
- Successfully resolved compatibility issues with TensorFlow, NumPy, and other dependencies
- Both methods work properly on arm64 architecture

## Implementation Details
- `test_demucs.py`: Working script for Demucs vocal extraction
- `test_spleeter.py`: Working script for basic Spleeter vocal extraction
- `test_spleeter_improved.py`: Enhanced Spleeter script with best practices
- `test_results/`: Directory containing extraction results

## Next Steps
1. Integrate Demucs into the main PitchTrack application
2. Consider optimizations to improve Demucs processing speed if possible
3. Potentially offer Spleeter as a faster alternative option when speed is more important than quality

## Notes
- The quality vs. speed trade-off is significant (Demucs: better quality but slower; Spleeter: lower quality but faster)
- For the PitchTrack application, vocal isolation quality is prioritized over processing speed
- Future TensorFlow updates may affect Spleeter compatibility due to deprecated APIs
