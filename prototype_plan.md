# PitchTrack Prototype Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for a research prototype to evaluate pitch detection algorithms for the PitchTrack application. The prototype will focus on processing pre-recorded audio files rather than real-time microphone input to simplify initial development.

## Project Structure

```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Create project structure
mkdir -p /Users/davidr/Documents/Software\ Projects/PitchTrack/prototype/{reference_tones,test_audio,results,src}

# Install required Python packages
pip install numpy matplotlib aubio librosa scipy
```

### 2. Generate Reference Tones

We'll create a Python script to generate reference tones with known frequencies:

- Pure sine waves at specific frequencies (A4=440Hz, etc.)
- Chromatic scales
- Simple melodies with known pitch progressions
- Variations with vibrato and different timbres

Alternatively, we can use GarageBand to create MIDI tracks and export as audio files.

### 3. Implement Pitch Detection

We'll implement multiple pitch detection algorithms for comparison:

- YIN algorithm (via Aubio)
- pYIN (probabilistic YIN)
- CREPE (if computational resources allow)

The implementation will:
- Load audio files
- Process them through each algorithm
- Extract pitch information
- Store results for analysis

### 4. Analyze and Visualize Results

Create tools to:
- Compare detected pitch against known reference pitch
- Calculate accuracy metrics (mean absolute error, etc.)
- Visualize pitch over time
- Identify problem areas (rapid transitions, vibrato, etc.)

### 5. Evaluation Framework

Develop a systematic approach to evaluate algorithms:
- Test across different frequency ranges
- Evaluate performance with different timbres
- Measure computational efficiency
- Assess latency implications

## Next Steps After Prototype

1. Select the best-performing algorithm for our needs
2. Implement real-time processing with microphone input
3. Integrate with visualization similar to SingAndSee
4. Add karaoke track playback and synchronization

## Timeline

1. Environment setup and reference tone generation: 1 day
2. Basic pitch detection implementation: 2-3 days
3. Analysis and visualization tools: 1-2 days
4. Evaluation and algorithm selection: 1-2 days

Total estimated time: 5-8 days for functional prototype

## Success Criteria

The prototype will be considered successful if it can:
1. Accurately detect pitch from pre-recorded audio files
2. Provide meaningful visualizations of pitch over time
3. Allow comparison between different algorithms
4. Inform the selection of an algorithm for the full application
