# PitchTrack Architecture

## System Overview

PitchTrack is a pitch training application that allows users to practice singing along with karaoke tracks while receiving real-time feedback on pitch accuracy. The system visualizes both the target vocal line and the user's actual pitch, providing immediate visual feedback and post-performance analysis.

## Core Components

### 1. Audio Processing Module
- **Pitch Detection Engine**: Implements algorithms (pYIN/CREPE) to analyze input audio in real-time
- **Audio Input Handler**: Manages microphone input and preprocessing
- **Signal Processing Utilities**: Filtering, normalization, and audio enhancement

### 2. Music Visualization Layer
- **Piano Roll Display**: Shows notes on a piano keyboard (similar to SingAndSee)
- **Pitch Tracking Visualization**: Displays real-time pitch as continuous line
- **Target Note Display**: Shows the expected notes from the song
- **Comparison Overlay**: Highlights matches/mismatches between target and actual pitch

### 3. Karaoke Playback System
- **Audio Playback Engine**: Handles synchronized playback of backing tracks
- **Vocal Track Isolation**: Ability to adjust/remove vocal tracks from songs
- **Timing Synchronization**: Ensures visualization aligns with audio playback

### 4. Performance Analysis Engine
- **Pitch Comparison Algorithm**: Compares target vs actual pitch data
- **Performance Metrics Calculator**: Quantifies accuracy, consistency, etc.
- **Problem Area Identification**: Highlights sections needing improvement

### 5. User Interface
- **Song Selection Interface**: Browse and select songs from library
- **Performance View**: Main interface during singing practice
- **Feedback Display**: Shows real-time and summary feedback
- **Settings and Configuration**: Calibration, sensitivity, display options

### 6. Data Management
- **Song Library**: Storage and organization of karaoke tracks
- **Performance History**: Recording and retrieval of past performances
- **User Profiles**: Progress tracking and personalized settings

## Data Flow

1. User selects a song from the library
2. System loads backing track and target vocal line data
3. User sings into microphone while backing track plays
4. Real-time audio processing detects pitch from microphone input
5. Visualization layer displays both target and actual pitch
6. System records performance data for analysis
7. Post-performance feedback highlights areas for improvement

## Technical Considerations

- **Latency Management**: Minimize delay between singing and visual feedback
- **Accuracy vs. Performance**: Balance computational requirements with real-time needs
- **Calibration**: Account for different microphones and environments
- **Extensibility**: Design for adding new features (e.g., harmony training, rhythm analysis)

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Core pitch detection and basic visualization
2. **Phase 2**: Karaoke playback integration and synchronized display
3. **Phase 3**: Performance recording and basic feedback
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced analysis and detailed feedback
5. **Phase 5**: User experience refinement and additional features

This architecture will evolve as the project develops, with regular reviews to ensure alignment with user needs and technical feasibility.
